   Implemented a DataLoader to load up initial data when Spring Boot application starts.
   Modified Entity from original, adding use of lombok and correcting entity structure to match Cake rather than Employee
   Modified description field JSON of CakeEntity to match incoming data from initial data source (JSON field 'descr')
